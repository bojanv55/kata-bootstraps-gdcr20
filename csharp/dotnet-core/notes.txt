Focus points
* high risk
* unclear features
  * seeding
* complex algorithm (find neighbors)

Core elements
* cells
* status: alive/dead
* find neighbors
* seeding (how to start)

Test List
* find alive neighbors 0-8
  * corner cases: finite / wrapped / infinite (sparse)
* status for next iteration
  * 4 rules
  * 18 cases (0-8 neighbors, dead/alive)
